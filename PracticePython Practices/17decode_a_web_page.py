Exercise 17

Note: this is a 4-chili exercise, not because it introduces a concept 
(although it introduces a new library), but because this exercise is 
more like a project. Feel free to skip this and come back when youâ€™re 
more ready!

Use the BeautifulSoup and requests Python packages to print out a list 
of all the article titles on the New York Times homepage.
